****Project Name: ****
Waste Water Management

**Background**
The waste water management project aims to monitor and optimize the treatment and disposal of wastewater in USA. The project involves multiple wastewater treatment plants, sources of waste water across various locations. The main objective is to ensure 
efficient treatment of wastewater.

**Goals**
• Ensure efficient and responsible treatment of wastewater to improve effectiveness and efficiency.
• Integrate data from different sources and performing analysis.
• Design Analytical Report.
• Provide Recommendations based on analytical report.

**Objectives and Scope**
1.Data Collection and observation: The project emphasis lies on collecting data related to treatment Plants, sources of waste water, and treatment results. These metrics
are used for analyzing the overall performance of treatment facilities.
2.Performance Analysis: The project aims to evaluate the performance of different treatment facilities. It seeks to identify areas of improvement, optimize treatment 
efficiency, and enhance the overall effectiveness of wastewater management systems.
3.Analysis of Waste Water Sources: The project recognizes the importance of understanding the sources of wastewater and their specific characteristics. It aims to 
analyze wastewater based on different sources such as residential, healthcare, or industrial to identify any specific treatment requirements.

**Deliverals**
1. Data Consolidation and Transformation: Consolidation of relevant data sources, such as wastewater treatment plant data, sources of waste water data into a structured 
format suitable for analysis.
2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Identify key performance indicators related to wastewater management.
